          <p>PintoCraft has now been running contiuously for over a year. We have had 3 complete seasons in that time, with the fourth still ongoing. When we started out we had 5 players, but now we have an active discord with over 50, and is set to expand more when PintoCraft Season 5 releases this summer. To read the full history of PintoCraft, please click <a href=./history/index.html>here.</a></p>
		  <h3>Early Developments</h3>	
		  <p>The earliest record of the server is from the 14th of December 2019. It is an announcement sent out by Pintodog, as an update on the status of the server's development. It reads: </p>
		  <q>Hello, sorry for the ping. A lot of people have been asking me how to get on the server. The answer to that question is you can’t. This is because I haven’t been able to locate the server files, which I need to access to set up the whitelist, set the seed and make myself an operator. The reason I can’t find these files is that the computer that will run the server doesn’t have a GUI-based operating system. This means that the only way you can use it is through commands. Please bear with me while I go on a Wildgoose chase.</q><br>
		  <p>This was then followed up with various announcements about the progress, until the 17th, when the server was opened publically for the first time. This was followed, two days and a server change later, by the announcement that we were changing the IP address, and hosting it on a Google Cloud server. This solved all the intermittent crash issues, meaning that PintoCraft Season 1 could continue uniterrupted. </p>
		  <h3>Season 1</h3>
		  <p>PintoCraft Season 1 officially began on the 17th of December 2019, and ran until the 29th of February 2020. Notable builds from the season include Pintodog's house and secret base, located in the hill behind the shopping area and dinotracking's house, which used a similar block palette, on the coast to the east of the shopping area. </p>
		  <h3>Season 2</h3>
		  <p>PintoCraft Season 2 began on the 7th of March 2020, and quietly passed on the 26th of June. Notable events and builds include the signing of the AdviSore contract between underscore_5 (Then BannaFace876) and MillzyG. Other notable builds include Pintodog's 'Tardis in the jungle' tower, and the witch farm, which was a collaboration between Pintodog and BannaFace876. The shopping district this season was fairly lively, with Pintodog's raid farm shop, later succeded by a concrete box that was going to sell redstone components, As well as a logs shop, owned by a mysterious seal, and a elytra and rocket shop, owned and operated by AdviSore. Later on in the season, the Guardian shop, also owned by AdviSore, and the Very Ancient Mining Co opened.</p>
		  <h3>Season 3</h3>
		  <p>PintoCraft Season 3 started, amidst the first national lockdown of 2020, on the 27th of June. While there were a few teething problems due to unwanted players, the season eventualy got off to a good start, and three major corporations formed. The first of these to form was EcoTec, a collaboration between Pintodog and underscore_5 to create an Eden Project-style base in the middle of the jungle, with gigantic glass domes, and a network of secure corridors and farms below. The Second corporation to form was MIX Industries, which was owned by MillzyG and later renamed to ΛIVIΛ (pronounced 'Aivia'). The idea behind MIX was to create an indxustrial wasteland full of super-efficient farms, in the middle of a desert. This was in complete contrast to EcoTec's eco-friendly domes. The third major corporation to form was SweetieCorp, developed by sweetiecat571. This corporation planned to build a 'mall' and sell all the essentials, such as food and rockets. As of right now, the season is still ongoing.</p>
